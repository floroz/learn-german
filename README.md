# Learn German: A1 to B2 Journey

Welcome to your personal German language learning repository! This space is designed to help you progress from A1 to B2 level, serving as both a learning guide and a quick refresher.

## Current Focus: A1 Level

We are currently focusing on A1 topics. As you progress, this document will be updated to reflect your journey.

## Processing Temporary Notes (tmp.md)

When new notes are added to `tmp.md`, follow these steps:

1.  **Read the entire 'tmp.md' file.**
2.  **Understand and categorize all the elements in there.**
3.  **Review whether the new learnings are already included in other files.**
4.  **Abstract away from the notes into creating a structured learning.** For example, if it's a list of verbs, some should go into `verbs.md`, or new examples should be added to existing files (e.g., a verb about eating should generate an example in `3-eating-and-drinking.md`).
5.  **Ensure all spelling is correct.**
6.  **Synthesize the content to avoid redundancy.**
