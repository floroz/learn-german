# Learn German: A1 to B2 Journey

Welcome to your personal German language learning repository! This space is designed to help you progress from A1 to B2 level, serving as both a learning guide and a quick refresher.

## Current Focus: A1 Level

We are currently focusing on A1 topics. As you progress, this document will be updated to reflect your journey.

## Processing Temporary Notes (tmp.md)

When new notes are added to `tmp.md`, follow these steps:

1.  **Read the entire `tmp.md` file.**
2.  **Understand and categorize all the elements within it.**
3.  **Review existing files** to determine if the new learnings are already covered or could be integrated.
4.  **Decide on the best approach for structuring the new learning:**
    *   **Integrate:** Add the new content or examples into relevant existing files (e.g., new verbs into `verbs.md`, new phrases into thematic lessons like `3-eating-and-drinking.md`).
    *   **Create New File:** If the content represents a new, distinct topic, create a new Markdown file for it.
    *   **Extract and Combine:** If the new content relates to a part of an existing large file, consider extracting that part into a new, more focused file and then integrate the new content from `tmp.md` into this new file.
5.  **Ensure all spelling is correct.**
6.  **Synthesize the content** to avoid redundancy and ensure clarity.
7.  **Update links** in `README.md` or other relevant files if new files are created or major restructuring occurs.
8.  **Clear `tmp.md`** after its contents have been successfully processed and integrated.

## Repository Structure and Strategy

This repository is organized to facilitate a structured approach to learning German, from A1 to B2 levels. The content is divided into thematic lessons, core grammar and vocabulary topics, and supplementary materials.

**Key Organizational Strategies:**
*   **Modular Grammar:** Core grammar concepts are broken down into specific, focused Markdown files (e.g., `articles-and-nouns.md`, `cases.md`, `verbs.md`). This allows for easier navigation, updating, and linking to specific rules from thematic lessons. The [German Grammar Rules Overview](./german-grammar-rules.md) serves as a central hub linking to these detailed files.
*   **Thematic Learning:** Vocabulary and grammar are often best learned in context. Thematic lessons (e.g., `1-greetings-and-introducing.md`) aim to integrate these aspects.
*   **Cross-Linking:** Efforts are made to interlink related topics across different files to create a cohesive learning experience. For example, a thematic lesson might link to a specific verb conjugation pattern in `verbs.md` or a case explanation in `cases.md`.
*   **Italian Speaker Focus:** Specific files like [Genders (Der, Die, Das)](./genders.md) provide targeted advice for Italian speakers, highlighting common areas of confusion or difference.
*   **Progressive Complexity:** The content is generally structured to build from A1 concepts upwards.
