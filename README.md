## Repository Structure and Strategy

This repository is organized to facilitate a structured approach to learning German, from A1 to B2 levels. The content is divided into thematic lessons, core grammar and vocabulary topics, and supplementary materials.

**Key Organizational Strategies:**
*   **Modular Grammar:** Core grammar concepts are broken down into specific, focused Markdown files (e.g., `articles-and-nouns.md`, `cases.md`, `verbs.md`). This allows for easier navigation, updating, and linking to specific rules from thematic lessons. The [German Grammar Rules Overview](./german-grammar-rules.md) serves as a central hub linking to these detailed files.
*   **Thematic Learning:** Vocabulary and grammar are often best learned in context. Thematic lessons (e.g., `1-greetings-and-introducing.md`) aim to integrate these aspects.
*   **Cross-Linking:** Efforts are made to interlink related topics across different files to create a cohesive learning experience. For example, a thematic lesson might link to a specific verb conjugation pattern in `verbs.md` or a case explanation in `cases.md`.
*   **Italian Speaker Focus:** Specific files like [Genders (Der, Die, Das)](./genders.md) provide targeted advice for Italian speakers, highlighting common areas of confusion or difference.
*   **Progressive Complexity:** The content is generally structured to build from A1 concepts upwards.
