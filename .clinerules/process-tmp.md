## Processing Temporary Notes (tmp.md)

When new notes are added to `tmp.md`, follow these steps:

1.  **Read the entire `tmp.md` file.**
2.  **Understand and categorize all the elements within it.**
3.  **Review existing files** to determine if the new learnings are already covered or could be integrated.
4.  **Decide on the best approach for structuring the new learning:**
    *   **Integrate:** Add the new content or examples into relevant existing files (e.g., new verbs into `verbs.md`, new phrases into thematic lessons like `3-eating-and-drinking.md`).
    *   **Create New File:** If the content represents a new, distinct topic, create a new Markdown file for it.
    *   **Extract and Combine:** If the new content relates to a part of an existing large file, consider extracting that part into a new, more focused file and then integrate the new content from `tmp.md` into this new file.
5.  **Ensure all spelling is correct.**
6.  **Validate the correctness** of the information in `tmp.md`: if a word is mispelled, a grammar rule is incorrect, or an example is unclear, it should be corrected before integration.
7.  **Synthesize the content** to avoid redundancy and ensure clarity.
8.  **Update links** in other relevant files if new files are created or major restructuring occurs.
9.  **Clear `tmp.md`** after its contents have been successfully processed and integrated.

Remember the overall goal is to create a list of files that allows for a comprehensive overview of the main aspects of the German language, from A1 to B2 levels.

Not everything in tmp.md should automatically be promoted to be integrated - if you believe an information, example or rule is already covered, you should notify of this decision and skip over that content.
